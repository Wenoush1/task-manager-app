# Life Manager App

## Goal
Create an app that helps streamline and manage daily tasks, time management, and financial management.

## Planned Feature List
1. **Task Management**
   - Users can manually create tasks with attributes: type, name, description, and estimated time to finish.
   - Users can add subtasks to tasks.
   - *Future enhancement*: Users can create recurring tasks with customizable frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

2. **Calendar Integration**
   - Connect to a Google Calendar or similar service.
   - Users can set minimal required daily free time and sleep time.
   - Users can set their daily work time and minimal required monthly work hours.
      - Users can create multiple different jobs/part-times with attributes like: minimum shift lenght,minimun hours per month, opening hours and if the shifts should be filled out automatically
      - Users can also add their school courses and expected time spent in school
      - Users should be able to press a button(or have it done automatically if they chose to) and the app will try to fill out their calender with as many shifts as it can to simplify shift planning
   - *Future enhancement*: Allow users to add friends and coordinate free time for hangouts.

3. **Financial Management**
   - Users can input their salary (which could be automated in the future based on work hours).
   - The app will calculate monthly payments (rent, bills, etc.) and subtract them from the salary.
   - The app will allocate the remaining money into recommended investment amounts, savings, and discretionary spending.
   - Users can estimate monthly spending on necessities (food, hygiene, utilities) and subtract this from discretionary spending.
   - Add a way to manage grocery expenses, categorizing items (food, sweets, alcohol, etc.) to optimize spending.

## Development Prioritization
1. **Task Management**
   - Start by developing the task management feature as it's core to the app's purpose.

2. **Calendar Integration**
   - Focus on integrating with a calendar service, ensuring tasks can be scheduled around work and free time.

3. **Financial Management**
   - Develop the financial management feature, starting with basic salary input and expense calculation.

4. **Enhancements**
   - Once the core features are working well, consider adding enhancements like recurring tasks, friend coordination, and automated salary calculation.
